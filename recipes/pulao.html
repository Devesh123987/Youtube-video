    <h1>Pulao</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/pulao.jpg" alt="Pulao">
    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Called by various names such as pilaf or pulav, veg pulao is one of the most common vegetarian rice dishes in India, the other being Veg Biryani.

        A pulao is a one pot dish of rice and vegetables or a protein cooked together with aromatics (onions, garlic, ginger etc), spices and herbs. There are many variations of making a pulav.</p>
        <p>What I like about making veg pulao is that it comes together quickly. Use a food processor for chopping the veggies and it will really come together fast.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mixed Vegetables - I have added, cauliflower, peas, carrots, beans and potatoes to this veg pulao dish.</li>
            <li>Whole spices - Bay leaves, cinnamon, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, star anise, green cardamom, cloves, black pepper corn and a blade of mace.</li>
            <li>Milk - I prefer adding little milk to the pulao for richer flavor. But, if you wish to make vegan pulao recipe, then go on ahead with adding little coconut milk or almond milk to it.  Or, skip using it.</li>
            <li>Other ingredients - Garam masala powder, little crushed nutmeg, ginger garlic paste, green chilies, sliced onions, ghee or oil, lemon juice, salt and water.</li>
       </ul>
