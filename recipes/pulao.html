    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Called by various names such as pilaf or pulav, veg pulao is one of the most common vegetarian rice dishes in India, the other being Veg Biryani.

        A pulao is a one pot dish of rice and vegetables or a protein cooked together with aromatics (onions, garlic, ginger etc), spices and herbs. There are many variations of making a pulav.</p>
        <p>What I like about making veg pulao is that it comes together quickly. Use a food processor for chopping the veggies and it will really come together fast.</p>
